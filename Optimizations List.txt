Future optimizations:
-Have a list of every custom assembly function we dynamically create and check to see if any of the new functions we're making fit its specifications. If they do, we can just point it to that function instead of duplicating the code
-Removing unnecessary libraries will help, but also consider seeing if we can get down to specific library usage instead of calling from a more general location.
-In instances where multiple floors share the same name, the name is duplicated in RAM. Minimizing duplication would be nice
-TemplateAccessors is basically held together with glue and paste, does not follow the more orderly structure of its younger sibling classes. Refactor for uniformity purposes.
-GetFloorName and associated code is currently unused and has no current plans to be used, so a refactor here could save us some space
Can probably abstract a good portion of the Accessors into a superclass that all of them inherit from, something to look at once everything's in place
