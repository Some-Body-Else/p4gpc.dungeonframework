Replace the current way the game checks if a field is a static, nonstatic or pregenerated floor, currently all based on ID number
-Replaced all in current list, but there may be more

Force modloader to check p4g mods folder to see if there are modified json files to run, default to preset templates if no substitutes are found

Fix .ENV files not being applied properly to dungeons (think its just not loading)

The above to-dos are the most necessary to get to a public release, anything below this is something to allow for more flexibility

All minimap functions are currently ignored, but can't ignore it forever.

Once all the above is finished, modifications to the dungeon-generating functions, currently expects 3x3 rooms to be the largest possible size, want to see if there's a way to stretch that number
